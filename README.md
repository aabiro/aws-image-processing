* About the App

This is a program for processing images, hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and includes a Lambda Function that resizes an image, triggered with a picture upload in an S3 bucket. I used the EB CLI and AWS CLI to implement all of these services on the cloud.


* Running the Photo Processing Program

Clone this repository

Activate the virtual environment:

`cd aws-image-processing`

`python -m pip install virtualenv`

`virtualenv venv -p python`

`cd venv`

`.\Scripts\activate`

Now that the virtual environment is activated:

`cd ..`

`cd imagepro`

`pip install django`\
`pip install Pillow`

`python manage.py runserver`

Once server is running go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and upload your photos.

Use `deactivate` to deactivate the virtual environment. 

# AWS Lambda resize function project with Node.js can be found [hare](https://github.com/aabiro/aws-lambda-image-resize "GitHub Repo")

* Also, using the Lambda Function included in this repo:

The lambda function I include here works with two S3 buckets, the source and destination.

The code expects to find a destination bucket with the same name as the
source bucket with the word "resized" appended to it.

Make an EC2 instance to connect with on the AWS CLI, with a user having the appropriate Lambda and S3 access permissions.

When connected create and activate the virtual environment, Install the needed libraries, Create a deployment package, copy the `lambda_function.py` file from the local drive to the EC2 instance, Add the functionâ€™s code to the archive, and deactivate your virtual environment. 

Then you can create and deploy the Lambda function with:

`aws lambda create-function --function-name <YOUR-FUNCTION-NAME> --zip-file fileb://<FUNCTION-CODE-ZIP-FILE-IN-ARCHIVE> --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler --runtime python3.6 --timeout 10 --memory-size 1024 --role arn:aws:iam::<YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID>:role/<ROLE-NAME-WITH-LAMBDA-PERMISSION>`

More details about the `create-function` command are available here:
[create-function documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/create-function.html "AWS CLI Command Reference")


Then give the S3 bucket the permission to invoke a lambda function with:

`aws lambda add-permission --function-name <YOUR-FUNCTION-NAME> --principal s3.amazonaws.com --statement-id s3invoke --action "lambda:InvokeFunction" --source-arn arn:aws:s3:::<SOURCE-BUCKET-NAME> --source-account <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID>`

Add Event notification configuration to the source bucket.

You will see a resized photo object in the S3 destination bucket when loading a picture in the source bucket.
